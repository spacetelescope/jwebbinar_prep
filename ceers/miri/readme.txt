This is the readme file for the simulated MIRI data products. 
The simulations and data reductions follow the procedures detailed in Yang et al. (2021, ApJ, 908, 144).


Part1 includes all input files necessary to reduce MIRI imaging in F770W and F2100W for CEERS 
pointing 7b, including a Jupyter notebook (pipeline_v1.1.ipynb) that demonstrates running all of the
Calibration Pipeline steps as well as custom processing steps we've developed for the simulated data.

***Note: Total disk space after running all steps in the notebook: ~10.5 GB


Software requirements for pipeline reduction:
    python (version >= 3.7)
    numpy
    matplotlib
    astropy
    jwst (https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst)
    sep (https://github.com/kbarbary/sep)
    astroscrappy (https://github.com/astropy/astroscrappy)

File explanation:
    pipeline_v1.1.ipynb
        is the script that reduced the raw MIRI data and produced the science and weight images.
        The file is in the format of python jupyter notebook file.

    CEERS{pt_id}/{filter}/det_image_seq{dth_id}_MIRIMAGE_{filter}exp{exp_id}.fits
        are the raw (pipeline-ready) MIRI data generated by MIRISIM v.2.4.0.
        {pt_id} is the pointing ID.
        {filter} is the filter name. 
        {dth_id} is the dither ID.
        {exp_id} is the exposure ID.
        The input sources are from the SAM catalog.

    CEERS{pt_id}/{filter}/final_image.fits
        are the science images produced by pipeline_v1.1.ipynb
        The units are megajansky per steradian (MJy/sr)

    CEERS{pt_id}/{filter}/final_wht.fits
        are the weight images produced by pipeline_v1.1.ipynb

    pointing_info/miri{pt_id}_reg.fits
        are the pointing WCS information.
        These are needed by pipeline_v1.1.ipynb

    model_cat/miri{pt_id}_src_sam.fits
        are the SAM model properties used as input for the MIRI simulations. 
        These can be considered as "true" quantities, testing your measurements.
