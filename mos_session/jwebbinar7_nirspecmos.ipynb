    "In this notebook, we will explore the stage 2 and 3 pipelines for NIRSpec MOS data. Here, we will focus on the mechanics of processing \"real\" example data, including how to use associations for exposure specification and multi-exposure combination, what particular steps actually do to the data, and what the primary data products at each stage look like. We will also see examples of how to interact and work with data models and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using pipeline version 1.2.3 for all data processing in this notebook. Most of the processing runs shown here use the default reference files from the Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS), with one exception at the end to show an example of how to modify/override. Please note that pipeline software development is a continuous process, so results in some cases may be slightly different if using a subsequent version. There are also a few known issues with some of the pipeline steps in this build that are expected to be fixed in the near future, though these do not significantly effect the products you will see here. Finally, some of the calibration reference files used by individual pipeline steps in the current CRDS context are placeholders, as they require calibrations that can only be taken in flight; this means that the absolute flux values and formal uncertainties in the products shown here are not physical and should not be taken literally."

    "We will be using simulated NIRSpec exposures generated by the ESA Instrument Performance Simulator (IPS). The simulations were created using an input scene consisting of multiple point sources within the MSA field of view, each described by an emission-line galaxy template spectrum at different redshifts. The observation included a series of three nodded exposures, in which each source is moved to a different shutter within its three-shutter slitlet. The instrument was configured with two different disperser settings: G235M+F170LP and G395M+F290LP. The nodded exposures are numbered for convenience in these example file names according to the ordering of the positions in the pattern. These file names are not indicative of actual data product file names you will see in the archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of caveats to be aware of regarding these simulated data. 1) The IPS does not include a full treatment of all of the effects corrected by the stage 2 pipeline, particularly some of the throughput components. As with the above caveat regarding reference files, the simulations shown here should not be used for any analyses of flux information. 2) The simulated PSF is truncated in order to save on computation time, which results in an artifical drop in apparent count rate in the PSF wings in some cases. 3) Some of the error arrays in the rate files are not populated, as those are normally generated during stage 1 of the pipeline. In addition to the reference file issue noted above, this means the final combined error values should be ignored. 4) Spacecraft pointing-related information has to be added by-hand to the headers before the simulated data can be processed by the pipeline. These keywords are used by the stage 3 pipeline when combining exposures, in order to align the spectral traces. In addition, the MSA metafile, used by the pipeline to determine open shutter and source information, also had to be created by-hand.  Because this has to be a manual process and may be subject to small errors, the quality of the combined products here should not be taken as indicative of actual in-flight performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note that these simulations are preliminary and will be replaced with newer versions in the near future, though after the webinar takes place.  For this reason, these data should only be used in the context of running this notebook, and we request that you not share the data.***"
