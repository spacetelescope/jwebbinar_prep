In this module, we will take a deeper dive into how JWST data products change through different stages of the JWST Calibration Pipeline (hereafter, the pipeline). We will start by examining the data products for Stage 1 and Stage 2 processing, and end by checking out the WCS information. In the third and final module for this JWebbinar, we'll continue on to explore Stage 3 data products. \n",

    "The first step in Stage 2 processing (\"Assign WCS\") is where the information to transfer the pixel coordinates to astronomical coordinates (e.g., RA and Dec) is added to the data. The WCS information and distortion model are provided by instrument- and detector- specific calibration reference files. The data itself is not modified by this step, it just associates a WCS object with each science exposure. The WCS object transforms positions in the detector frame to positions in a world coordinate frame - ICRS and wavelength. In general, there may be intermediate coordinate frames depending on the instrument. The WCS is saved in the ASDF extension of the FITS file and can be accessed as an attribute of the meta object when the FITS file is opened as a data model.\n",

    "\n",
    "The JWST Assign WCS step is based on [GWCS](https://gwcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and uses the modeling, units and coordinates subpackages in Astropy. GWCS provides a more general approach to the problem of expressing transformations between pixel and world coordinates. It supports a data model that includes the entire transformation pipeline from input coordinates (detector by default) to world coordinates and is tightly integrated with Astropy, rather than using the FITS WCS standard, which only provides instructions on how to relate pixel to world. GWCS will provide observers with the complete transform. \n",
    "\n",
    "The forward direction of the transforms is from detector to world coordinates and the input positions are 0-based. Basic WCS keywords are contained in the science headers, while distortion and spectral models are stored in reference files in the ASDF format.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each observing mode, the \"Assign WCS\" step (or ```assign_wcs```) retrieves calibration reference files and creates a pipeline of transforms from the input detector frame to the V2,V3 frame. This part of the WCS pipeline may include intermediate coordinate frames. The basic WCS keywords are used to create the transform from V2,V3 frame to world coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "To display images with software like DS9 that relies on specific WCS information, a SIP-based approximation to the WCS is fit. The results are FITS keywords stored in ```model.meta.wcsinfo```. While this is not an exact fit, it is accurate to ~0.25 pixel and should be sufficient for display purposes. This step is performed by default, but observers can turn it off manually or adjust the parameters that control the fit. This step will be discussed more in the pipeline tutorial JWebbinars. "

    "When you're learning about JWST data products for Stage 2 and Stage 3 processing, it is a good time to mention JWST associations, since the association files are a part of the JWST data products used to process data through Stage 2 and Stage 3. Associations are basically just lists of files, mostly exposures, that are related in some way. For JWST, associations have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Relationships between multiple exposures are captured in an association.\n",
    "* An association is a means of identifying a set of exposures that belong together and may be dependent upon one another.\n",
    "* The association concept permits exposures to be calibrated, archived, retrieved, and reprocessed as a set rather than as individual objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it takes many exposures to make up a single observation, and an entire program is made up of a large number of observations. Given a set of exposures for a program, there is a tool that groups the exposures into individual associations. These associations are then used as input to the Stage 2 and 3 calibration steps to perform the transformation from exposure-based data to source-based, high(er) signal-to-noise data. The association used to process data is available in MAST as part of the \"Info\" data product category. You can read more about associations [here](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/associations/index.html). "

Unless you are generating your own data or simulations, you will probably not need to create an association file, because you will have the option to retrieve association files from MAST along with your data for reprocessing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you do want to create an association, there are also [command line tools](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/associations/asn_from_list.html) included in the pipeline software that help with generating associations for manually running the pipeline. "
