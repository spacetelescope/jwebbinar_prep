The exposure level products are updated at this stage to provide the highest quality data products that include the results of ensemble processing (e.g., updated WCS, matching backgrounds, and a second pass at outlier detection). These products are available in MAST, along with the unrectified 2D and rectified 2D products. More information can be found in the [JWST User Documentation](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-science-calibration-pipeline-overview/stages-of-jwst-data-processing).
