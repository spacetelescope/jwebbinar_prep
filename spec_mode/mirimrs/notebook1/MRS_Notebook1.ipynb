    "\n",
    "In this notebook we provide an introduction to JWST spectroscopic mode data reduction, focusing on the specific use case of the integral-field unit (IFU) observing mode.  As a demonstration case we use IFU data for the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) IFU; while many of the pipeline steps are similar for both MIRI and NIRSpec IFUs we note differences where they arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a simple simulated MRS point source observation (created using mirisim: https://wiki.miricle.org/Public/MIRISim_Public), process the data through the Detector1 pipeline (which turns raw detector counts into uncalibrated rate images), the Spec2 pipeline (which turns uncalibrated rate images into calibrated rate images), and the Spec3 pipeline (which turns calibrated rate images into composite data cubes and extracted 1d spectra).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Detector1 pipeline has been discussed extensively in previous JWebbinars we will not dig into that stage of the pipeline in detail, and focus instead on the Spec2 and Spec3 stages.  We will step individually through each step in these two pipeline stages, discuss how they work, and examine some sample outputs.  Since we'll be examining each step individually, this notebook is thus not a good template to use for designing your own notebook to process/inspect large quantities of observational data.  This use case is more directly addressed by MRS Calibration Notebooks #2 and #3 (point sources and extended sources respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "A few additional caveats:\n",
    "- This notebook covers the v1.1.0 baseline pipeline as it existed in February 2021.  The pipeline is under continuous development and there are therefore some changes in the latest pipeline build that will not be reflected here.\n",
    "- Likewise, there are some advanced algorithms slated for development prior to cycle 1 observations that will not be discussed here."

    "As noted above, in this notebook we will be processing simulated data created with the 'mirisim' tool.  Like the pipeline, mirisim is also an evolving piece of software and there are multiple known issues that can cause problems.  A few of the most important such mirisim issues include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- FAST mode has incorrect noise properties, rendering FAST mode data processed by the pipeline unreliable.  The simulations in this notebook therefore use simulated SLOW mode data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extended sources are not simulated unless they meet a minimum size that varies with each band.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Point sources are not simulated properly, with the PSF profile being simulated incorrectly in the cores.  Mirisim simulations therefore should not be used to study the PSF shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reference pixels are not treated consistently, the refpix step of detector1 must therefore be turned off to process mirisim data without artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Channel 4 flux calibration is incorrect in mirisim.  No workaround is currently available- channel 4 fluxes provided by the pipeline from simulated data will be incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- WCS alignment is incorrect in mirisim, causing sources to jump in location by a couple of pixels between channels.  No workaround is available- do not use mirisim data to test spatial alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flux conservation is not perfect within mirisim.  Likewise, the aperture correction factors in use by the pipeline correspond to the expected performance in flight (to be udpated during on-orbit commissioning) and are not well matched to mirisim data.  No workaround available, do not use mirisim data to test flux conservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- mirisim does not add all of the necessary header keywords for the pipeline to know how to do background subtraction, identify source type, etc.  In order to get these APT-derived keywords correct they will need to be set manually."

    "In this section we set things up a number of necessary things in order for the pipeline to run successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll set the CRDS context; this dictates the versions of various pipeline reference files to use.  Ordinarily you wouldn't want to set a specific version as the latest pipeline should already use the most-recent reference files (and hard-coding a version could get you old reference files that have since been replaced).  However, since this demo is using an old version 1.1.0 of the pipeline, we need to tell it to get some more recent reference files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll import the various python packages that we're actually going to use in this notebook, including both generic utility functions and the actual pipeline modules themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll specify the data directory structure that we want to use.  In order to keep our filesystem clean we'll separate simulated inputs and outputs from each pipeline stage into their own folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for convenience in this JWebbinar we'll define a flag that sets whether or not to actually run some of the longer pipeline steps in this notebook or just to rely upon cached reductions provided ahead of time.  This is because a number of steps (particularly building 3d data cubes) can take quite a long time to run, and in a short Webbinar we don't want to be waiting for them to all run in real time.  This flag is set to False by default for use in the live Webbinar; if you want to experiment with running all steps yourself ahead of time just set this flag to True.  Total notebook runtime with True/False values is about 1.5 hours vs 3 minutes.\n"

    "The MIRI MRS is expected to see a substantial background signal, especially in Channel 4 where the telescope thermal background becomes significant.  It will therefore be necessary to subtract this background (strictly, a foreground) signal from the data prior to analysis.  Ideally, this background should be sufficiently smooth and uniform that it is possible to model it and subtract the model from the science data (see Spec3- Master Background).  However, it is possible that the signal has sufficient spatial/spectral variability that it may prove necessary to do background subtraction via direct subtraction of on/off pointings.\n",

    "This background step in the Spec2 pipeline is largely a placeholder for if it becomes necessary to do such a direct subtraction at the cost of increased total noise.  As such, we do not recommend running this step at the present time- additional guidance will be provided after on-orbit commissioning.  If we *were* to run the step, here's one way in which in could be done.\n",

With a four-point dither pattern we have A-B-A'-B' pointings; where the A-B offset distance is large and the A' and B' pointings are close to the A and B pointings respectively.

    "Now that we've got fully calibrated 2d detector-level data (\\_photom.fits if we've run the pipeline step by step, \\_cal.fits if we simply ran the spec2 pipeline as a whole) the pipeline builds some simple data cubes from each exposure.  These are multi-band data cubes that combine data from both channels on a given detector into a single data cube with a large blank region in the middle corresponding to the gap between the bands (e.g., it would create a 1A+2A data cube from the SHORT wavelength detector with the SHORT grating setting, and have an empty gap corresponding to the 1B+1C wavelength range).\n",

    "The Spec3 pipeline is the first place where we really have to deal with many files at the same time and how they interact with each other (i.e., background observations, dithered observations, etc).  As such, we need to create an 'Association File' describing these files and how they should be treated by the pipeline.  These files are still under some development, and the recommended methods of using them will likely change before Cycle 1.  We'll therefore define a function to create a very simple association file that will treat all exposures it is given as science exposures to be combined together.\n",

    "In general, cosmic rays should have been flagged in the Detector1 pipeline as jumps in the readout ramp and corrected when determining the final slope image.  However, sometimes fainter cosmic rays slip through Detector1, and other outliers (due to bad pixels, etc) can be present that cause artifacts in the final data cubes.  The Outlier Detection routine is designed to identify and flag these artifacts.\n",

This cleaned cube is mapped back to the 2d calibrated detector data of each exposure, and outliers in individual frames with respect to this mapped-back data are flagged.  When we next do cube building, it will use this updated flagging to construct our high-quality combined data cube.\n",

    "Now that all of our individual exposures have been flux calibrated, background subtracted/matched, and any outliers flagged for removal, we can finally build a composite data cube from our dithered data!  Under the hood we've already been using this code for the background matching and outlier detection steps, but this step is the one that produces a 'final' 3d output product from the pipeline.\n",

    "Note, however, that in the example given below we're building cubes directly from the 2d calibration data (\\_cal.fits files), and thus not incorporating any changes from the outlier detection or residual background matching steps.  This is why it's much simpler to run Spec3 as a pipeline (as demonstrated in MRS Notebook 2) as the relevant information is transparently passed from step to step.\n",

    "A final word of caution: the data cubes created by the JWST pipeline are in SURFACE BRIGHTNESS units (MJy/steradian), not flux units.  What that means is that if you intend to sum spectra within an aperture you need to be sure to multiply by the pixel area in steradians first in order to get a spectrum in flux units (the PIXAR_SR keyword can be found in the SCI extension header).
