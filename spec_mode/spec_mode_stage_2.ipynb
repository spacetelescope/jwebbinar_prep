    "This notebook covers the Stage 2 processing of the JWST spectroscopic data, also known as *calwebb_spec2*. This material should serve as a reference guide when you need to run *calwebb_spec2*, or any of its constituent steps, in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "**_IMPORTANT_**: The goal of this notebook is not to actually run the pipeline, since each step is only applied to specific JWST modes, but rather to illustrate *what* each step is doing and *how* you would run it if you need to. Any code below is provided to showcase how to run the pipeline or any steps, and is not intended to actually be run.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Calwebb_spec2* is the \u201cSwiss army knife\u201d of JWST pipelines. It contains corrections that are only applied to certain instruments and/or instrument modes. The pipeline is a wrapper which will string together the appropriate steps for each exposure in the proper order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [*calwebb_spec2* pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_spec2.html#calwebb-spec2) applies corrections to slope images (countrate files) which are the output files of the [Stage 1 pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_detector1.html#calwebb-detector1). These slope images will be in the form of either *_rate* files (mean countrate across all integrations) or *_rateints* files (one countrate image per integration). A single input file can be processed or an association file listing multiple inputs can be supplied, in which case the processing steps will be applied to each input exposure one at a time. If *_rateints* products are used as input, each step applies its algorithm to each integration in the exposure, where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main output from *calwebb_spec2* is a fully calibrated, but unrectified, exposure with suffix *_cal*, in units of MJy/str (or MJy for NIRSpec or NIRISS SOSS point sources). The exact datamodel type of this file will depend on the spectrocpic mode in use, see the [documentation](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_spec2.html#d-or-3d-calibrated-data) for complete details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, 1D extracted spectral products are also created. For non-TSO observations, these are *_x1d* files containing extracted spectra for one or more slits/sources. For TSO observations, these are 3D *_x1dints* files with extracted spectra for each integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, 2D or 3D rectified products (*_s2d* and *s3d*) may also be produced depending on the mode in use. However, these files are meant only for user examination of the data. It is the *_cal.fits* files that are passed on to Stage 3 of the pipeline."
