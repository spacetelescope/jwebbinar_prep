    "## Introduction to Specviz\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn to load and display a spectrum in Specviz\n",
    "- Become familiar with the tools attached to the spectrum viewer\n",
    "- Become familiar with the data analysis plugins\n",
    "- Learn how to select a region of interest/subset of the spectrum\n",
    "- Learn how to overlay spectral lines on the displayed spectrum\n",
    "- Learn how to extract spectra from the Specviz app for further analysis in the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Historical Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, Specviz was one of three separate packages (Specviz, Cubeviz, and Mosviz) for visual data analysis. These packages have now been unified into separate configurations of a single project called Jdaviz and share much of the same codebase. The main relevance this has to you is that you should _not_ try to install Specviz via `pip install specviz`, as this will give you the old, no-longer-maintained package. Instead, always use `pip install jdaviz` to get Specviz and the other configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The Specviz documentation can be found at https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specviz/index.html. "

Since we're creating a new subset, the default (\"replace\") is fine.\n",

Zooming works by scrolling with the mouse wheel (see \"Sidebar: zooming from the notebook\" below if you can't scroll to zoom).\n",
    "3. Click the \"x-range\" selection tool in the expanded tool tray.\n",

    "You should now see the label \"Subset 1\" with a red triangle in the app-level toolbar where it previously said \"No selection (create new)\". The red triangle indicates that the region of the spectrum you selected in the viewer should be colored red to indicate it is in this subset."
