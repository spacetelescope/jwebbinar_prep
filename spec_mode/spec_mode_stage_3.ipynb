    "This notebook covers the Stage 3 processing of the JWST spectroscopic data, also known as *calwebb_spec3*. This material should serve as a reference guide when you need to run *calwebb_spec3*, or any of its constituent steps, in the future. We will not address spectroscopic Time Series Observation (TSO) calibration, which is handled by a separate pipeline [*calwebb_tso3*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_tso3.html#calwebb-tso3).\n",

    "The [*calwebb_spec3* pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_spec3.html) takes one or more calibrated slope images (`*_cal.fits` files) stored in an association file (detailed [below](#associations)) and outputs different types of files, depending on the spectroscopic mode in question. \n",

    "1D extracted spectral products, with suffix *_x1d*, are produced for all spectroscopic modes. Combined 1D spectral products, with suffix *_c1d* are produced for WFSS and non-TSO SOSS modes. Resampled 2D products (*_s2d* files) will be created for non-IFU modes, while resampled and combined 3D products (*_s3d* files) are created for IFU modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps performed in order to reach these final products vary with spectroscopic mode. Wide-Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) and non-TSO SOSS modes are minimally processed by *calwebb_spec3*, while NIRSpec and MIRI modes undergo more correction steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "All JWST spectroscopy mode data, except SOSS TSO data, are processed through the *calwebb_spec3* pipeline. The pipeline is a wrapper which will string together the appropriate steps for each exposure in the proper order."

    "This step uses the collection of input files to identify and flag any cosmic rays or other transient image artifacts that were not flagged by the jump step in calwebb_detector1. While the jump step looked for large pixel-based deviations in the signal from group-to-group within an integration, the outlier detection step looks for large sky-based exposure-to-exposure deviations in the signal. If a given location on the sky shows no signal above the noise in 4 out of 5 exposures, but a bright source in the remaining exposure, the outlier detection step will flag in the DQ map the pixels containing the source in the fifth exposure. These pixels will be ignored when the exposures are later combined into a final mosaic image.\n",

For MIRI, for example, this can mean separate cubes for bands 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 1B, 2B, …, 3C, 4C, depending on what’s included in the input. For NIRSpec this may mean multiple cubes, one for each grating+filter combination contained in the input collection. The *calwebb_spec3* pipeline calls `cube_build` with `output_type=band`. These types of IFU cubes will have a linear-wavelength dimension. If the user wants to combine all the data together covering several band they can using the option `output_type=multi` and the resulting IFU cubes will have a non-linear wavelength dimension.\n",

    "#### Summary\n",
    "This step computes a weighted average of 1D spectra and writes the combined 1D spectrum output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each pixel of each input spectrum, the corresponding pixel in the output is identified (based on wavelength), and the input value multiplied by the weight is added to the output buffer. Pixels that are flagged (via the DQ column) with “DO_NOT_USE” will not contribute to the output. After all input spectra have been included, the output is normalized by dividing by the sum of the weights. The weight will typically be the integration time or the exposure time, but uniform (unit) weighting can be specified instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output wavelengths will be increasing, regardless of the order of the input wavelengths. In the ideal case, all input spectra would have wavelength arrays that were very nearly the same. In this case, each output wavelength would be computed as the average of the wavelengths at the same pixel in all the input files. The combine_1d step is intended to handle a more general case where the input wavelength arrays may be offset with respect to each other, or they might not align well due to different distortions. All the input wavelength arrays will be concatenated and then sorted. The code then looks for “clumps” in wavelength, based on the standard deviation of a slice of the concatenated and sorted array of input wavelengths; a small standard deviation implies a clump. In regions of the spectrum where the input wavelengths overlap with somewhat random offsets and don’t form any clumps, the output wavelengths are computed as averages of the concatenated, sorted input wavelengths taken N at a time, where N is the number of overlapping input spectra at that point.\n",
