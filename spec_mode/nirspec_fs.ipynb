    "In this notebook, we will explore the stage 2 and 3 pipelines for spectroscopic data, using the NIRSpec Fixed Slit mode as an example.  Since the previous two notebooks described these pipelines and all their component steps for all spectroscopic modes, we will focus on the mechanics of processing \"real\" example data, including how to use associations for background subtraction and multi-exposure combination, what particular steps actually do to the data, and what the primary data products at each stage look like.  We will also briefly examine how to interact and work with data models for each product.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using pipeline version 1.1.0 for all data processing in this notebook. Most of the processing runs shown here use the default reference files from the Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS), with one exception at the end to show an example of how to modify/override. Please note that pipeline software development is a continuous process, so results in some cases may be slightly different if using a subsequent version.  There are also a few known issues with some of the pipeline steps in this build that are expected to be fixed in the near future, though these do not significantly effect the products you will see here.  Finally, some of the calibration reference files used by individual pipeline steps in the current CRDS context are placeholders, as they require calibrations that can only be taken in flight; for this reason, the absolute flux values seen here should not be taken literally."

    "We will be using simulated NIRSpec exposures generated by the ESA Instrument Performance Simulator (IPS), using an input scene consisting of a point source with an A-star stellar model spectrum. The observation consists of 9 dithered exposures with the S200A1 slit, including a 3-point primary dither pattern with spectral subdithers. The instrument was configured with the PRISM+CLEAR grating/filter combination and a detector subarray of SUBS200A1 (2048x64 pixels on each detector). The dithers are numbered for convenience in these example file names according to the source position in the slit, as shown schematically below.

    "There are a number of caveats to be aware of regarding these simulated data.  1) The IPS does not include a full treatment of all of the effects corrected by the stage 2 pipeline, particularly some of the throughput components. As with the above caveat regarding reference files, the simulations shown here should not be used for any analyses of flux information.  2) The simulated PSF is truncated in order to save on computation time.  In some cases, you may see an artifical drop in apparent count rate in the PSF wings.  3) Spacecraft pointing-related information has to be added by-hand to the headers before the simulated data can be processed by the pipeline.  These keywords are used by the stage 3 pipeline when combining exposures, in order to align the spectral traces.  Because this has to be a manual process and may be subject to small errors, the quality of the combined products here should not be taken as indicative of actual in-flight performance."

Both a rectified 2D and extracted 1D spectrum are generated.  The pipeline includes includes an outlier detection step that compares the stack of values at each resampled pixel and flags outliers based on noise threshold parameters; the flagged outliers are not included in the spectral combination. However, we will skip this step because the simulations are noiseless, which would result in spurious results.  We will also not demonstrate the optional \"master background\" step, which takes an independent 1D background spectrum to create a 2D background to subtract in the absence of nodded exposures; see the read-the-docs pages for more details."
