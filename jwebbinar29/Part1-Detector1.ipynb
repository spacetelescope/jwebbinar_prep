In particular, below about 20,000 counts it seems the correction makes the last group difference to be slightly larger than the first group differences; this changes for the larger fluences, where the last group difference seems to have a _smaller_ flux than the first group differences. This is actually consistent with a _charge migration_ hypothesis, on which pixels that receive larger fluences _lose_ charge to neighboring pixels that receive them.

Then, it jumps to the next in the same column in 10 microseconds, and so on. When it reaches the end of a column after jumping in this case through 32 pixels, the electronics are ordered to wait 120 microseconds exactly before moving to the next column. And then the process repeats. 1/f noise in this context arises because the readout electronics have noise associated with it, and the power spectral density (PSD) of this noise, if one \"tags\" each pixel with the clocking process described above, has a $1/f^{\\beta}$ shape --- with the power index, $\\beta$, being very close to 1. \n",

    "There's a wide array of techniques and software [from the community](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-planning/tools-from-the-community) that aim at removing this 1/f noise at different stages. Here, we will try a very simple algorithm to (aim to) remove it: we will subtract background pixels on each column to the entire column, hoping this alleviates this 1/f noise. To do this, we need to follow two steps: (1) identify pixels that are \"non-illuminated\" in the detector, (2) remove the median of those pixels on every column for every group and integration. Let's do this next.\n",

    "To create a \"background pixel mask\", we will here simply work with the first segment of data --- doing the same for all segments of data together is left as an exercise to the reader. The first step to generating this mask is to find a good estimate of the \"median\" frame --- i.e., how the median or average frame looks like. A good trick for this is to use the \"last-minus-first\" frames, which as the name suggests, simply removes the last group from the first to generate an estimate of the frame for a given integration. Let's do this for NRS1 and NRS2:"

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> <b>Note on 1/f correction methods</b>: For TSOs, there is some discussion in the literature about whether attempting to remove 1/f noise at the group-level, at the rate-level (i.e., after all the steps in <code>detector1</code>) or both is the way to go --- and whether simplistic algorithms like the one above are optimal. The reality is that, at the time of writing, the jury is still out on the final answer. We thus encourage readers to try different methodologies and find the one that works best for their scientific use-case. As a start, an interesting reader might, e.g., skip the above 1/f removal algorithm and simply try to remove it at the rate-level --- or perform no removal at all, and see differences in the final lightcurve precision."

In some cases, this might be significantly off (or <code>detector1</code> corrections might not be optimal as to leave significant detector effects) such that the algorithm might be shown to be too aggressive. Similarly, the algorithm relies on a decent amount of groups in the integration to work properly (larger than about 5). It is, thus, important to try different parameters to identify jumps in a given dataset and study their impact on the final products. One of the most important parameters is the <code>rejection_threshold</code>. The default value is <code>4</code>, but TSO studies in the literature have sometimes opted for more conservative values (typically larger than 10).
