# JWebbinar material

## Branch frozen for Webbinar 13

This Branch is a frozen version for JWebbinar  "CEERS -Â NIRCam and MIRI imaging". If you want a version of the materials that is being maintained, see the `main` branch of this repository.

To download the material, you can clone this repository and navigate to this folder:  
`git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwebbinar_prep.git ~/my_jwebbinar_prep`  
`cd ~/my_jwebbinar_prep`  
`git checkout webbinar13`  
`cd ceers`  

Alternatively, you can manually download the individual notebooks by clicking on the ceers folder, then click on each file, and right-click on "Raw" to select "Save link as".

To run these notebooks locally, you will need a Python environment set up that is capable of running Jupyter notebooks. If you are new to Python, you may want to look here: https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/ for some resources on how to install and learn the basics of Python. Depending on your preferences and system choices, you may find the install instructions there sufficient, but note that many scientists find it easier to use the Anaconda python distribution and package manager: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.

The ceers/ folder contains the nircam/ and the miri/ folders. In each of those, you will find a README with instructions to create the appropriate environments and run the notebooks.
