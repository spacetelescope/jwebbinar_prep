    "Welcome to JWST Data Analysis Tools (JDAT) demonstration of Mosviz, a Multi-Object Spectrograph visualziation tool built atop the Jdaviz framework. This notebook will demonstrate some of the features we've built into Mosviz to facilitate the specialized usecase of MOS analysis. To learn more about Mosviz, see our [Mosviz Documentation](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mosviz/index.html). To learn more about the Jdaviz framework and how you can build your own tool for your usecase, see our [Jdaviz Documentation](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/)\n",

This demo goes through a simulated NIRISS WFSS MOS dataset and demonstrates the MOS-specific features of Mosviz to help visualize and analyze your data. Specifically, in this demo, we will attempt to identify a spectral emission line and model fit the emission curve:\n",

As the field of view is adjusted in either the 1D or 2D spectral viewer, the other viewer will synchronously pan and zoom as well.\n",

    "Many of the features you've seen in other the other tools built on the Jdaviz framework are automatically included here in Mosviz as well. We'll be demonstrating one of them here: the Model Fitting Plugin. This plugin is designed to attempt to fit a model onto a 1D spectral viewer. You can find our plugin tray on the right side of Jdaviz under the \"Plugin\" icon in the top right corner. From there, select the `Model Fitting` dropdown. We will be attempting a simple Constant + Gaussian model fit.\n",
    "1. To start, we'll need to select the spectral emission feature we want to fit. To do this, open the toolbar in the 1D spectral viewer and select the \"Region Select\" tool. Once we've zoomed in to visually identify the emission feature, use your mouse to draw a region around the spectral feature.\n",
    "2. With the region selected, you can inspect your \"Regions Tray\" at the top of the viewer. Here you'll see an inventory of all the regions you've drawn. If this is the first region you've selected, it should be named, by default, as \"Subset 1\". \n",
    "3. In the Model Fitting Plugin, select \"Subset 1\" as the data we'll be fitting against. \n",
    "4. Add a constant model and give it a name, in this case \"Constant\". This name should not include any whitespaces (spaces, tabs, etc.). You should see a constant model being added with an initial \"best fit\" provided by the tool.\n",
    "5. Likewise add a gaussian model and give it a name, in this case \"Gaussian\".\n",
    "6. In the \"Model Equation Editor\", type out your equation. In this case, we'll be attempting a simple Constant + Gaussian model fit, so I'll enter `Constant + Gaussian`. You'll substitute the names with the ones you've provided above.\n",
    "7. Hit Fit and a fit will be attempted on the spectrum you've selected. Based on your selected region, our backend will attempt to fit your model as best it can. If you get unsatisfactory results, try redrawing your model and trying again."
