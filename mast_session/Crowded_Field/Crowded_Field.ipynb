    "    1. Conduct a search for observations.\n",
    "    2. Retrieve the set of products for those observations.\n",
    "    3. Download the products you want.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Then we will walk through these steps for a wide-field slitless spectroscopy program, and explain some of the challenges involved when there can be thousands of products associated with the observations. We will show how you can filter these products to only get the ones you need, and demonstrate the batch download technique we recommend when requesting large amounts of data, to make your retrieval process as smooth as possible.

    "NOTE: the `obsid` parameter is an internal reference ID, defined by a unique integer, and is only used to look-up products in our cross-mission database tables by specific functions.  Since it is just a random, unique number, by itself it has no value to a user, and furthermore MAST reserves the right to change this value over time.\n",

    "This is in stark contrast to the `Observation ID` column you see in the Portal browser (the `obs_id` column if using `astroquery.mast`), which *is* a more useful identifier to a given MAST observation, since it is a string that encodes information about the observation following rules defined by the mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary: `obsid` is a more-or-less random integer that contains no useful insignt other than to serve as a pointer to a particular observation at MAST.  It is used only by MAST functions behind-the-scenes or when calling `download_products()` without relying on the return value of `get_product_list()`.  `Observation ID` (in the Portal GUI) or `obs_id` (in `astroquery.mast`) is a unique string that follows a naming convention defined by the mission.\n",
