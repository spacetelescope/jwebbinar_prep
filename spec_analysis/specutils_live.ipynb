    "## Objects for representing spectra\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fundamental purpose of `specutils` is to contain the shared Python-level data structures for storing astronomical spectra.  It is important to recognize that this is not the same as the *on-disk* representation.  As desecribed later specutils provides loaders and writers for various on-disk representations, with the intent that they all load to a common set of in-memory/Python interfaces.  Those intefaces (implemented as Python classes) are described in detail in the [relevant section of the documentation](https://specutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types_of_spectra.html), which contains this diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Specutils Classes](specutils_classes_diagrams.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The core principal is that all of these representations contain a `spectral_axis` attribute as well as a `flux` attribute (as well as optional matching `uncertainty`).  The former is often wavelength for OIR spectra, but might be frequency or energy for e.g. Radio or X-ray spectra.  Regardless of which spectral axis is used, the class attempts to interpret it appropriately, using the features of `astropy.Quantity` to distinguish different types of axes.  Similarly, `flux` may or may not be a traditional astronomical `flux` unit (e.g. Jy or  erg sec$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ angstrom$^{-1}$), but is treated as the portion of the spectrum that acts in that manner.  The various classes are then distinguished by whether these attributes are one-dimensional or not, and how to map the `spectral_axis` dimensionality onto the `flux`.  The simplest case (and the one primarily considered here) is the scalar `Spectrum1D` case, which is a single spectrum with a matched-size `flux` and `spectral_axis`."
