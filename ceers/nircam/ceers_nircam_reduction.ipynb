    "The Stage 1 [*calwebb_detector1* pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_detector1.html#calwebb-detector1) applies basic detector-level corrections to all exposure types (imaging, spectroscopic, coronagraphic, etc.). It is applied to one exposure at a time, beginning with an uncalibrated multiaccum ramp (*_uncal.fits file). Each input raw data file is composed of one or more ramps (integrations) containing increasing count values from the non-destructive detector readouts. For details on multiaccum files and data collection, see the JDox page on [how up-the-ramp readouts work](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/understanding-exposure-times#UnderstandingExposureTimes-uptherampHowup-the-rampreadoutswork). The final output from this call is an uncalibrated slope image which is ready to go into the Stage 2 pipeline. \"Uncalibrated\" in this case means that the data are in units of DN/sec. In Stage 2 the flux calibration will be applied, at which point the data will be in physical units (e.g. MJy/sr) and referred to as \"calibrated\".\n",
    "\n",
    "All JWST data, regardless of instrument and observing mode, are processed through the Stage 1 pipeline. The corrections performed are the same across all near-IR instruments. See [Figure 1](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-science-calibration-pipeline-overview/stages-of-jwst-data-processing/calwebb_detector1) on the *calwebb_detector1* algorithm page for a map of which steps are performed on NIR data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sections below, we will run the entire Stage 1 pipeline on two uncalibrated NIRCam files. The pipeline is a wrapper which will string together all of the appropriate steps in the proper order. To explore how each individual step of the Stage 1 pipeline changes the input data, please see the ['Ramps to Slopes' notebook from JWebbinar 3](https://stsci.app.box.com/s/z5bznws56f9m1j505vhnpud35nxrjr50). \n",

This is likely due to a mismatch between the input photometric calibration parameters used by Mirage in simulating the data and those used by the `jwst` calibration pipeline. Specifically, Mirage translates input magnitudes into count rates using HST-style PHOTFLAM values derived from filter throughput curves. Mirage uses the same PHOTFLAM value for all short wavelength detectors for a given module and filter. The `jwst` calibration pipeline, however, converts count rates to MJy/sr using the 'photmjsr' parameter in the flux calibration reference file, which depends on the pixel area and a mean gain value, both of which vary detector to detector. A single value does not exist that can bring all simulated detector images to the same background level. Additionally, the CEERS dithers are not large enough to cover the gaps between detectors, and so there are many exposures with no overlap area in common for globally matching the sky values.<br><br>\n",
