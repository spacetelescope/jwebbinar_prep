Jdaviz tour 2023
=============================

Thank you for joining the Jdaviz tour 2023!
We would like to share with you the latest developments in the ecosystem of
data analysis tools developed at STScI to work with JWST data.

Agenda
------
1. Presentation "JWST from photons to science"
2. Getting set up locally or on the science platform
3. Exploring the UNCOVER dataset with Imviz
4. Browsing through CEERS spectra with Mosviz and Specviz2d
5. Looking at moons and planets with Cubeviz

Getting set up
--------------
Extensive instructions to set up an environment with Jdaviz can be
found online here:
https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
In brief, you can create a fresh conda environment with
  conda create -n jdaviz python=3.10 -y
Activate the envioronment
  conda activate jdaviz
Install jdaviz
  pip install jdaviz
Then you can get the material by cloning a branch of the jwebbinar_prep
repository with git
  git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwebbinar_prep.git --branch jdaviz-tour
This includes a notebook example to query and download data from MAST and
three notebooks to run the examples at points 3, 4, and 5 above.
The data used in the notebooks are quite heavy (lots of photons!). It would
be ideal if you could download these before the presentation starts.

If for any reason, this fails on your machine or you have problems with the
downloads, we are interested to see the problems and we will help you debug,
but if there is not enough time to debug your problem in person,
you can use the science platform: https://jwebbinar.science.stsci.edu/
This is not available at all times, but it will be ready just before the presentation
and available for some time after the presentation. **You will need a MyST account
to access it.**
