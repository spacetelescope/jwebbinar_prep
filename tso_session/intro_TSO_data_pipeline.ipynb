    "\n",
    "In this notebook we provide a realistic example for running the JWST pipeline on a JWST Time Series Observation (TSO). For the purposes of this tutorial we will work with a simulated observation with the MIRI Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS). In particular, we focus on aspects of the pipeline that differ from \"standard\" algorihtms and procedures. There will not be enough time to look at every step in detail, but we will demonstrate how to make changes to the pipeline setting (and why you might want to do that) for the best scientific utility. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the notebook uses JWST Calibration Pipeline version 1.3.3, which is the current version at the time of this JWebbinar. The pipeline will however be further developed and updated post-launch. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a simple simulated MIRI LRS observation, created using MIRISim version 2.4.1, which is compatible with pipeline version 1.3.3 (https://wiki.miricle.org/Public/MIRISim_Public). The data are described in more detail below. \n"

    "We used the MIRISim software package (v2.4.1) to generate realistic simulations of a MIRI LRS slitless observation of a simple stellar-type point source. The stellar SED was modelled as a simple black body spectrum with the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Temperature = 6230 K\n",
    "* Normalised to K = 8.99, or flux of 20 mJy at 2 $\\mu$m. \n",
    "\n",
    "LRS slitless observations are carried out in the SLITLESSPRISM subarray of the MIRI Imaging detector. The subarray has 416 rows x 72 columns (the left-most 4 columns are reference pixels, i.e. no illuminated), with sampling of 0.11 arcsec/pix. The single-frame read time for this subarray is 0.159 seconds, and the FASTR1 read mode has an extra reset between integrations. We perform an observation of 100 groups, 10 integrations, in a single exposure; giving an exposure time of:\n",

    "\n",
    "**MIRI TSO-specific caveats**\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is no \"TSO\" flag in MIRISim; the software does not set the header keyword that the pipeline looks for to recignise whether an exposure is a TSO. We will set this manually in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MIRISim is not able to insert a time-variable signal into a simulated observation. The source flux is assumed to be constant. Additional tools have been developed in the MIRI consortium for this purpose, but for the aims of this tutorial we do not consider this. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The MIRI LRS prism has a leak in its transmission that causes some 3-4 $\\mu$m flux to contaminate the spectrum around 6-7 $\\mu$m. This is not included in the MIRISim models. \n",

However, this effect is also stable over time for a given source, so for TSOs we prefer to use the last frame for maximal SNR.
