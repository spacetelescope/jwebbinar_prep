Then, it jumps to the next in the same column in 10 microseconds, and so on. When it reaches the end of a column after jumping in this case through 256 pixels, the electronics are ordered to wait 120 microseconds exactly before moving to the next column.

That is --- simply select all non-illuminated pixels in a column, take their mean/median, and remove it for that column.

As can be seen from the plot above as well, the smaller the ammount of pixels one considers, the more \"white\" the noise appears to be. For example, it is clear that if one only looks at lengthscales smaller than about 10 pixels, then the underlying noise is mostly white. This means that the smaller the aperture used to extract the spectra, the lower the impact of 1/f noise. A corollary of this is that it also means that the smaller the subarray (and/or the spectral profile), the better for 1/f noise as the noise will look mostly white. \n",
