This indicates that using the x-range selection tool will create a new subset, rather than editing an existing subset. To the right of that button you should see a small circle - clicking that circle shows that there are options for what the x-range selection will do. Since we're creating a new subset, the default (\"replace\") is fine.\n",

    "1. Click the \"hammer and screwdriver\" icon in the top left of the viewer. \n",
    "2. Use any of the pan/zoom tools (the leftmost three icons in the expanded tool tray) to zoom into the feature of interest. We'll investigate the broad emission feature near 6900 Angstrom. Zooming works by scrolling with the mouse wheel (see \"Sidebar: zooming from the notebook\" below if you can't scroll to zoom)\n",
    "3. Click the \"x-range\" selection tool in the expanded tool tray.\n",
    "4. Click and drag on the viewer to select a region around the feature.\n",
    "5. Click the \"x-range\" button in the expanded tool tray to deselect the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now see the label \"Subset 1\" with a red triangle in the app-level toolbar where it previously said \"No selection (create new)\". The red triangle indicates that the region of the spectrum you selected in the viewer should be colored red to indicate it is in this subset."

The default behavior is to add newly loaded lines to the existing list.\n",

    "1. Create a subset that includes some continuum on either side of the broad emission feature, then use the Model Fitting plugin to fit a constant model to that subset. Using `specviz.get_spectra()`, retrieve the data from the app and use the continuum fit to normalize the spectrum. Load the normalized spectrum back into the app.\n",
