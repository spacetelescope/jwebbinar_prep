    "Welcome to the first module about JWST data products! JWST is a complex observatory with four instruments and many modes, so there is a lot to learn about about the different types of data and their formats, and the tools available to help observers examine and analyze their data. In this JWebbinar, we will examine JWST data products and how they change as they go through the pipeline. We will start with uncalibrated data and proceed through the processing stages of the JWST data calibration pipeline (hereafter, the pipeline) in separate modules, highlighting important notes along the way. Detailed information about how to run the pipeline will be saved for the next couple of JWebbinars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most JWST science data products are in FITS format, which should be familiar to observers. However, there are ancillary input and output files for the pipeline that are not; there are JSON files (used to associate different observations), ASDF files (typically pipeline configuration files), and ECSV files (for ASCII table data, such as catalogs). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will begin by exploring an example uncalibrated JWST observation to get a sense of the format, and then we will demonstrate a very important tool designed to simplify the complexity of JWST data: data models. In the notebook for the next module, we will explore the input and output data products for the first stage of processing in the pipeline. \n",
