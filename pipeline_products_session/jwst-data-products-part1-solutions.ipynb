    "Welcome to the first module about JWST data products! JWST is a complex observatory with four instruments and many modes, so there is a lot to learn about about the different types of data and their formats, and the tools available to help observers examine and analyze their data. In this JWebbinar, we will examine JWST data products and how they change as they go through the pipeline. We will start with uncalibrated data and proceed through the processing stages of the JWST data calibration pipeline (hereafter, the pipeline) in separate modules, highlighting important notes along the way. Detailed information about how to run the pipeline will be saved for the next couple of JWebbinars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most JWST science data products are in FITS format, which should be familiar to observers. However, there are ancillary input and output files for the pipeline that are not; there are JSON files (used to associate different observations), ASDF files (typically pipeline configuration files), and ECSV files (for ASCII table data, such as catalogs). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will begin by exploring an example uncalibrated JWST observation to get a sense of the format, and then we will demonstrate a very important tool designed to simplify the complexity of JWST data: data models. In the notebook for the next module, we will explore the input and output data products for the first stage of processing in the pipeline. \n",

    "JWST data models are important if you are working with JWST data and associated software, since much of the JWST software assumes the use of data models. They help insulate steps, pipelines, and users from the complexities of JWST file formats, and allow us to maintain a common framework for the data across the JWST-specific software. You can think of them as a container for your data that allows for consistency in formatting, data types, and expected headers for all the different types of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are different data models for different kinds of data. Each model generally has several arrays that are associated with it. For example, the ImageModel has the following arrays associated with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* data: The science data\n",
    "* dq: The data quality array\n",
    "* err: The error array\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure and design of the data models take advantage of the ASDF features and functionality, so they can easily be searched, edited, updated, and saved. You can always use ```<model>.info()``` to look at the contents of a data model. It renders the underlying ASDF tree, showing information about the metadata, data arrays, formats, etc."
