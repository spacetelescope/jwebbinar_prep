    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers part 2 of the imaging mode data calibration module. In this notebook we'll review Stage 2 of the JWST calibration pipeline for imaging data, also known as *calwebb\\_image2*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Stage 2 pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_image2.html) applies instrumental corrections and calibrations to the slope images output from Stage 1. This includes background subtraction, the creation of a full World Coordinate System (WCS) for the data, application of the flat field, and flux calibration. In most cases the final output is an image in units of surface brightness. Whereas the input files had suffixes of `*\\_rate.fits*`, the output files have suffixes of `*\\_cal.fits*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the steps above, the Stage 2 pipeline will also run the [resample](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/resample/main.html) step on the calibrated images, in order to remove the effects of instrument distortion. This step outputs files with the suffix *\\_i2d.fits* that contain \"rectified\" images. However, these files are meant only for user examination of the data. It is the *\\_cal.fits* files that are passed on to Stage 3 of the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how the steps of the pipeline change the input data, we will download several sample files and run them through the pipeline, examining the results at several places along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "All JWST imaging mode data, regardless of instrument, are processed through the *calwebb\\_image2* pipeline. The steps and the order in which they are performed is the same for all data. For the purposes of this notebook, we will continue with the processing of the NIRCam data used in the Stage 1 notebook. We will also provide example MIRI files that can be used in a separate exercise."
