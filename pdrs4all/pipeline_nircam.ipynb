    "Massive stars disrupt their natal molecular cloud material by dissociating molecules, ionizing atoms and molecules, and heating the gas and dust. These processes drive the evolution of interstellar matter in our Galaxy and throughout the Universe from the era of vig- orous star formation at redshifts of 1-3, to the present day. Much of this interaction occurs in Photo-Dissociation Regions where far-ultraviolet photons of these stars create a largely neutral, but warm region of gas and dust.\n",
